solving sudoku with backtraching algorithm

This repository provides python scripts that allows to solve the Sudoku Game. show the solution as a matrix and models the Sudoku Game as a CSP.    
It gets n as the size of the board,c as the number of sudoku givens, the position for them, and the sudoku givens.   
If there was a solution, it returns the solution as a matrix and if there wasn't, it returns "unsolvable CSP!"   
This code uses Backtracking algorithm for solving the Sudoku game and it can solve the game for n = 2, 4, 9
